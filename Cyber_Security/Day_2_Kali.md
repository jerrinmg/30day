# Day 2: Kali Linux
Today going to learn task 3 which is a learning task.
## A. Precautions

Lets continue where we left off yesterday, installing the tools for Kali lInux.
So just have to make sure that when installing these packages if my IP goes to them or not. Im 90% sure that it does.

Ah, got the answer it does not, 
### Step 1 
So next step, after installing these tools, Im pretty sure Im going to need to use Tor for browsing. That will be the next step. So lets boot to kali and install the top 10 packages.
### Failure
This ended in an failure. I was not able to set up proxy chain properly or fix my internet issue. I am thinking of reinstalling Kali OS with the tools or install BlackArch or normal Arch.

## Knowledge
Types of proxy: Dynamic, Random, Round Robin, Strict
Protocols: SOCK4/5
