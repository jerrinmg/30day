**Defensive Security: SOC, Threat Intelligence DFIR**
=====================================

### Security Operations Center (SOC)

* Monitors network and systems to detect malicious cyber security events
* Areas of interest:
	+ Vulnerabilities
	+ Policy violations
	+ Unauthorized activity
	+ Network intrusions


### Threat Intelligence

* Aims to gather information to help companies prepare against potential adversaries
* Involves collecting, processing, and analyzing data to identify threats and predict attacks
* Enables threat-informed defense and mitigation of attacks

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

* **Digital Forensics**:
	+ Analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators
	+ Focus areas: file system, system memory, system logs, network logs
* **Incident Response**:
	+ Methodology for handling cyber attacks and data breaches
	+ Four phases: preparation, detection and analysis, containment and recovery, post-incident activity![image](https://github.com/jerrinmg/30day/assets/166682032/f17ba3c5-d3e6-4bd7-a542-5481b5c19fc7)

* **Malware Analysis**:
	+ Learning about malicious software (malware) to understand its behavior and impact
	+ Types of malware: virus, Trojan horse, ransomware
	+ Analysis techniques: static analysis, dynamic analysis
