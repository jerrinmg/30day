## Day 2 Arduino Uno

Yesterday I worked on installing the IDE. Today we are going to run some basic programs and find out what register level programming is.

### Step 1: Program Extraction

1. Before we move, lets first do the optional task of yesterday.
2. After 1 hour of failure, this is where i'm stopping the pursuit of this task for now.
3. Basically I was trying to launch avrdude to get the hex code from the arduino but unsuccessful.

### Errors

If you are wondering about the line that had the error here it is.

### Knowledge

1. HEX files: I did end up finding [something](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Get-Code-Program-Back-From-Arduino/) about extracting HEX. Link will be in the additional tasks section ( for another day). That is HEX files is generated and thats the file that is uploaded to the flash of the MC(microcontroller.

###

Additional tasks:

1\. Extract the program [hex](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Get-Code-Program-Back-From-Arduino/). Some other day. You might need another AVR board for that.  

### Result

Failed: did not achieve the aim for today. : “Today we are going to run some basic programs and find out what register level programming is”.

- Transfer unfinished aim onto tomorrow.
