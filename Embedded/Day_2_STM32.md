# Day 2: Finish the installation and Setup

So earlier we had installed the STM IDE, which also includes the CUBEMX program.

## Step 1: 
 Now we just need to install the programmer. 
 
1)Okay, installing the programmer took some more time and steps. 
2) The installer resulted in creating a file named in the Desktop of which I had to enable 2 enable permission as executable 
“ Allow Launching “ and “ Allow executable”.


## Step 2: Installing

1. Little hiccup, the download file was .sh file, Had to make the permissional executable in settings, similar to what I did with Arduino IDE with ch +x
2. More hiccup, wow running the script is daunting! This is the closest I have been made to forcefully read all the conditions when installing a software.

## Result 
 We have installed the Programmer(left) and the IDE (right). Stopping here for now for today.
