# Day 1: Prepare to Blink ! STM32 NUCLEO-F303ZE

So we had installed all the required software needed to run the STM32. Next is blinking the STM32! But I feel like it won't be as easy as doing it as in the case of Arduino which we did today.

## Step 1:  Datasheets and guides for the STM32 NUCLEO-F303ZE
Pre: Figure out the environment of STM32. 

1)For the Arduino UNO I had noted down all the specs of the device. But I wont be doing that here right for now. 
2) So let’s look at the Board and resources available. 
    A) ST Website
    B) ARM MBED Website 
3) Okay so here’s the confusion :

When you download the documentation in this you find:

The exact details of the board are not here. I guess and think that this is for the entire 144 series.

You find the above reference when you search through, and when you click on it. You land on the exact page of the product that I bought.

and bingo ! That’s the datasheet. Its a 1 7 3 page pdf. Now you know why I did not choose to note down all the features of the board as I did for Arduino! 

Stopping Here for now! 

## Result 
Downloaded the Datasheets and other required documents.
