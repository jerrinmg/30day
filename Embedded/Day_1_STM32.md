# Day 1: Installation and Setup

Decided to work on STM32 as it is used more in the industry. Using Ubuntu OS to better familiarize with the OS and CLI.

## Step 1: Learn the tools
Pre: Figure out the environment of STM32. 

1. Thankfully the product I bought had a link to the product website. 
Upon inspection I came across this:

2. It must be the 2nd one, which I need to program, I thought. But Ive decided to look around the website, I saw that there was 2 other programs 
   ```bash
   STM32CubeIDE 
   STM32CubeMX
   STM32CubeProgrammer ( already seen )

   ```
3. Upon further study, I found out I need all 3!
**STM32CubeIDE** for development and debugging.
**STM32CubeMX** for configuration.
**STM32CubeProgrammer** for flashing the firmware.



## Step 2: Installing


Time to install. 

1. Little hiccup, the download file was .sh file, Had to make the permissional executable in settings, similar to what I did with Arduino IDE with ch +x
2. More hiccup, wow running the script is daunting! This is the closest I have been made to forcefully read all the conditions when installing a software.


3.Tip: Try repeatedly pressing enter and y , dayum after spending 10 minutes just trying to accept the terms and conditions, I found out all you had to do was press space to get to the next section. 

## Result 
Installed STM32 IDE
